## Description
Utilized front end starter code and created a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express, to allow users to view, create and track daily workouts. Users are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, and track the name, weight, sets, reps, duration of exercise and distance traveled if the exercise is cardio.
